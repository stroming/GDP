# MyFutureExam
A little program that is going to solve every exercise on my future exam ..

# ForecastingAndPlanning
Is intended as a calculator for my Forecast and Planing subject in UNSS

The user inputs a series of data: the time from which we start colecting data, the data itself and an alpha coef.
After the user iputs the data, he picks(soon to be implemented) a calculating method and the program calculates the forecast for the next 
X days/months/years
# Usage
* add a alpha coeficient(1<a<0)
* add a starting point of data collected (i.e. year or day or month)
* add data for each subsequent year
* pick a calculating method
# Building
